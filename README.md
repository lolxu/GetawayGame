# Getaway Game
This is a mobile game made in Unity. Currently, it only runs on Android, and here's the [Itch.io link](https://lolxu.itch.io/getaway). This is my final project for ITP382â€”Mobile Games Programming.

For this project, I solved an interesting race condition problem between Unity AI navigation and the Physics system. (Well, I just added some delays switching when the car enters physics mode vs. pathfinding mode)

I also created a custom pixel shader using HLSL to create a retro feel for this game.
